        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Amazing noodles with Short Rib</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>1 pound <strong>short ribs</strong> (meat removed from bone, fat trimmed, cut into smallish chunks)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>gochujang sauce</strong> (more gochujang = more spicy! I would say this amount is medium spicy)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>tomato paste</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced <strong>fresh ginger</strong></li>
            <li>6 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, crushed/minced</li>
            <li>1 <strong>shallot</strong>, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4-6 cups <strong>beef broth</strong></li>
            <li>10-16 ounces <strong>\dry ramen noodles</strong> or any other stir-fry noodles (I use 2-3 individual serving size packages)</li>
            <li>spinach (optional)</li>
            <li>scallions, sesame seeds, and/or sesame oil on top</li>

        </ol>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Set Instant Pot to the sauté mode. Sprinkle short ribs generously with salt; sauté without disturbing them until browned on the outside. 
            </li>
            <li>Add gochujang, tomato paste, ginger, garlic, and shallots to the Instant Pot with the short ribs and sauté for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add broth. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. When the cook time is up, the meat should be extremely tender and yummy.</li>
            <li>Set to the sauté mode again. Add noodles and cook until the noodles are softened. Taste broth and season with salt, pepper, maybe a shot of rice vinegar? and anything else you want.</li>
            <li>Sauté spinach in a separate pan (optional).</li>
            <li>Serve noodle soup bowls topped with the short ribs, sautéed spinach, scallion, sesame seeds, and sesame oil.</li>
        </ol>
