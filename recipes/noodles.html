        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Amazing noodles</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>1 (3.35 ounce) <strong>package saucy shortcut noodles</strong> - my favorite are the Momofuku spicy soy or soy scallion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons <strong>butter</strong></li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons <strong>honey</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon <strong>toasted sesame oil</strong> <em>(more to taste)</em></li>
            <li>a splash of <strong>water</strong></li>
            <li>optional toppings: <strong>green onion, sesame seeds, chili crisp, togarashi</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the noodles according to package directions, including adding in the little sauce packet.</li>
            <li>Once prepared, toss hot noodles gently with the butter, honey, and sesame oil. Taste and adjust to however you like it. It should be silky when hot but it will get more sticky the longer you wait - if it's too sticky, add a bit of warm water to loosen it which will emulsify and make it just a little creamy. It's perfect.</li>
            <li>Finish with chili crisp, scallions, or some kind of sesame or spicy sprinkle! Ideal little snack, or you can make it more of a rounded out meal by serving with a fried egg and/or a salad. Or ground chicken. Or shrimp. It's the kind of thing that's good with everything.</li>
